# Kaspa Stratum Adapter

This is a lightweight daemon that allows mining to a local (or remote) kaspa node using stratum-base miners.

This daemon is confirmed working with the miners below in both kaspa-only and dual-mining modes (for those that support it) on Windows/MacOs/Linux/HiveOs.
* bzminer
* lolminer
* srbminer
* teamreadminer
* IceRiver ASICs <font size="1">[*(setup details)*](#iceriver-asics-configuration-details)</font>
* Bitmain ASICS

# Features:

### Shares-based work allocation with miner-like periodic stat output

```

========================================================== ks_bridge_v1.1.7 ===
```


### Variable difficulty engine (vardiff)

Multiple miners with significantly different hashrates can be connected to the same stratum bridge instance, and the appropriate difficulty will automatically be decided for each one.  Default settings target 20 shares/min, resulting in high confidence decisions regarding difficulty adjustments, and stable measured hashrates (1hr avg hashrates within +/- 10% of actual).


### Optional monitoring UI

### Prometheus API

If the app is run with the `-prom={port}` flag the application will host stats on the port specified by `{port}`, these stats are documented in the file [prom.go](src/kaspastratum/prom.go). This is intended to be use by prometheus but the stats can be fetched and used independently if desired. `curl http://localhost:2114/metrics | grep ks_` will get a listing of current stats. All published stats have a `ks_` prefix for ease of use.

# Installation

## Option 1: Build from source (native executable)

* Install go 1.18 or later using whatever package manager is approprate for your system, or from https://go.dev/doc/install.

* run `cd cmd/kaspabridge;go build .`

* Modify the config file in ./cmd/bridge/config.yaml with your setup, the file comments explain the various flags

* run `./kaspabridge` in the `cmd/kaspabridge` directory

All-in-one (build + run) `cd cmd/kaspabridge/;go build .;./kaspabridge`

## Option 2: Docker all-in-one

*Best option for users who want access to reporting, and aren't already using Grafana/Prometheus.  Requires a local copy of this repository, and docker installation.*
  
* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) using the appropriate method for your OS.  The docker commands below are assuming a server type installation - details may be different for a desktop installation.

* Clone this repository using git (`git clone https://github.com/rdugan/kaspa-stratum-bridge.git`) or download and unpack the [zip file](https://github.com/rdugan/kaspa-stratum-bridge/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

* Enter the 'kaspa-stratum-bridge' directory and type the command `docker compose -f docker-compose-all-src.yml up -d --build` [^1].  This will run the bridge assuming a local kaspad node with default port settings, and listen on port 5555 for incoming stratum connections.  These settings can be updated in the [config.yaml](cmd/kaspabridge/config.yaml) file, or overridden by modifying/adding/deleting the parameters in the 'command' section of the [docker-compose-all-src.yml](docker-compose-all-src.yml) file.  Additionally, Prometheus (the stats database) and Grafana (the dashboard) will be started and accessible on ports 9090 and 3000 respectively.  Once all services are running, the dashboard should be reachable at <http://127.0.0.1:3000/d/x7cE7G74k1/ksb-monitoring> with default user/pass: admin/admin

[^1]: This command builds the bridge component from source, rather than the previous behavior of pulling down a pre-built image.  You may still use the pre-built image by replacing 'docker-compose-all-src.yml' with 'docker-compose-all.yml', but it is not guaranteed to be up to date, so compiling from source is the better alternative.

Many of the stats on the graph are averaged over a configurable time period (24hr default - use the 'resolution' dropdown to change this), so keep in mind that the metrics might be incomplete during this initial period.


## Option 3: Docker bridge only

*Best option for users who want docker encapsulation, and don't need reporting, or are already using Grafana/Prometheus.  Requires a local copy of this repository, and docker installation.*

* [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) using the appropriate method for your OS.  The docker commands below are assuming a server type installation - details may be different for a desktop installation.

* Clone this repository using git (`git clone https://github.com/rdugan/kaspa-stratum-bridge.git`) or download and unpack the [zip file](https://github.com/rdugan/kaspa-stratum-bridge/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)

* Enter the 'kaspa-stratum-bridge' directory and type the command `docker compose -f docker-compose-bridge-src.yml up -d --build` [^2]. This will run the bridge assuming a local kaspad node with default port settings, and listen on port 5555 for incoming stratum connections.  These settings can be updated in the [config.yaml](cmd/kaspabridge/config.yaml) file, or overridden by modifying/adding/deleting the parameters in the 'command' section of the [docker-compose-bridge-src.yml](docker-compose-bridge-src.yml) file.  No further services will be enabled.

[^2]: This command builds the bridge component from source, rather than the previous behavior of pulling down a pre-built image.  You may still use the pre-built image by issuing the command `docker run -p 5555:5555 onemorebsmith/kaspa_bridge:latest`, but it is not guaranteed to be up to date, so compiling from source is the better alternative.


# Configuration

Configuration for the bridge is done via the [config.yaml](cmd/kaspabridge/config.yaml) file in the same directory as the executable, or `./cmd/kaspabridge` from the project root if building from source / using docker.  Available parameters are as follows:


```
# stratum_listen_port: the port that will be listening for incoming stratum 
# traffic
# Note `:PORT` format is needed if not specifiying a specific ip range 
stratum_port: :5555

# kaspad_address: address/port of the rpc server for kaspad, typically 16110
# For a list of public nodes, run `nslookup mainnet-dnsseed.daglabs-dev.com` 
# uncomment for to use a public node
# kaspad_address: 46.17.104.200:16110
kaspad_address: localhost:16110

# min_share_diff: only accept shares of the specified difficulty (or higher) 
# from the miner(s).  Higher values will reduce the number of shares submitted, 
# thereby reducing network traffic and server load, while lower values will 
# increase the number of shares submitted, thereby reducing the amount of time 
# needed for accurate hashrate measurements
#
# If var_diff is enabled, min_share_diff will be the starting difficulty.
#
# Default value is chosen to accomodate current top of the line IceRiver ASICs.
# If you don't want to change the default to match your device(s), the vardiff 
# engine will adjust to an appropriate diff for lower hashrate devices within a 
# few minutes.
min_share_diff: 4096

# pow2_clamp: restrict difficulty to 2^n (e.g. 64, 128, 256, etc). This is 
# required for IceRiver and BitMain ASICs, where difficulties further away from
# powers of 2 cause higher error rates.  Using this feature will limit the 
# functionality of vardiff, such that the shares_per_min becomes more of a 
# minimum, rather than a target we can expect to converge on.
pow2_clamp: false

# var_diff: if true, enables the auto-adjusting variable share diff mechanism. 
# Starts with the value defined by the 'min_share_diff' setting, then checks 
# every 10s whether each client is maintaining a 20 shares/minute submission 
# rate, and sends an updated min diff per client if necessary.  Max tolerance 
# is +/- 5% after 4hrs.
var_diff: true

# shares_per_min: number of shares per minute the vardiff engine should target.
# Default value is chosen to allow for 99% confidence in measurement accuracy, 
# which affects fidelity of difficulty update decisions, as well as hashrate
# stability (measured 1hr avg hashrate should be within +/- 10% of actual, with
# the noted confidence.)  Higher values will result in better vardiff engine
# performance and increased hashrate stability.  Lower values will cause 
# vardiff to behave more erratically, while measured hashrate will display 
# larger variations.
#
# Incorrect configuration of this parameter may induce high error rates on 
# IceRiver devices, so it is recommended to avoid unnecessary changes.
# 
# Example values and their resulting confidence levels:
# 20 => 99%, 15 => 95%, 12 => 90%
shares_per_min: 20

# var_diff_stats: if true, print vardiff engine stats to the log every 10s 
var_diff_stats: false

# block_wait_time: time to wait since last new block message from kaspad before
# manually requesting a new block.  Examples are '500ms', '3s', '1m', etc.
block_wait_time: 3s

# extranonce_size: size in bytes of extranonce, from 0 (no extranonce) to 3. 
# With no extranonce (0), all clients will search through the same nonce-space,
# therefore performing duplicate work unless the miner(s) implement client
# side nonce randomizing.  More bytes allow for more clients with unique 
# nonce-spaces (i.e. no overlapping work), but reduces the per client 
# overall nonce-space (though with 1s block times, this shouldn't really
# be a concern). 
# 1 byte = 256 clients, 2 bytes = 65536, 3 bytes = 16777216.
extranonce_size: 0

# print_stats: if true will print stats to the console, false just workers
# joining/disconnecting, blocks found, and errors will be printed
print_stats: true

# log_to_file: if true logs will be written to a file local to the executable
log_to_file: true

# prom_port: if specified, prometheus will serve stats on the port provided
# see readme for summary on how to get prom up and running using docker
# you can get the raw metrics (along with default golang metrics) using
# `curl http://localhost:{prom_port}/metrics`
# Note `:PORT` format is needed if not specifiying a specific ip range 
prom_port: :2114

```

Config parameters can also be specificied by command line flags, which have slightly different names (these would be added in the 'command' subsection of the 'ks_bridge' section of the appropriate 'docker-compose-*.yml' file for docker installations.)  This method has precedence over the config.yaml file:

```
  - '-log=true' # enable/disable logging
  - '-stats=false' # include stats readout every 10s in log
  - '-stratum=:5555' # port to which miners should connect
  - '-prom=:2114' # port at which raw prometheus stats will be available
  - '-kaspa=host.docker.internal:16110' # host/port at which kaspad node is running
  - '-mindiff=64' # minimum share difficulty to accept from miner(s)
  - '-vardiff=true' # enable auto-adjusting variable min diff
  - '-pow2clamp=false' # limit diff to 2^n (e.g. 64, 128, 256, etc)
  - '-sharespermin=20' # number of shares per minute the vardiff engine should target
  - '-vardiffstats=false' # include vardiff stats readout every 10s in log
  - '-extranonce=0' # size in bytes of extranonce
  - '-blockwait=3s' # time in to wait before manually requesting new block
  - '-hcp=' # port at which healthcheck is exposed (at path '/readyz')
```

## IceRiver ASICs configuration details

IceRiver ASICs require a 2 byte extranonce (extranonce_size=2), an increased minimum share difficulty (use vardiff, or see table below), and difficulty values limited to 2^n (pow2_clamp=true).  Without these settings, you may experience lower than expected hashrates and/or high invalid rates.  

It is recommended to allow the variable difficulty engine to determine the proper diff setting per client (enabled by default), but if you prefer to set a fixed difficulty, disable vardiff, and consult the following table for the recommended settings for each of the different devices (should produce minimum 20 shares/min):

|ASIC   | Min Diff |
| ----- | ---- |
|KS0    |   64 |
|KS0PRO |  128 |
|KS1    |  512 |
|KS2    | 1024 |
|KS3L/M | 2048 |
|KS3    | 4096 |

See previous sections for details on setting these parameters for your particular installation.
