# min_share_diff: only accept shares of the specified difficulty (or higher) 
# from the miner(s).  Higher values will reduce the number of shares submitted, 
# thereby reducing network traffic and server load, while lower values will 
# increase the number of shares submitted, thereby reducing the amount of time 
# needed for accurate hashrate measurements
#
# If var_diff is enabled, min_share_diff will be the starting difficulty.
#
# Default value is chosen to accomodate current top of the line IceRiver ASICs.
# If you don't want to change the default to match your device(s), the vardiff 
# engine will adjust to an appropriate diff for lower hashrate devices within a 
# few minutes.
min_share_diff: 4096

# pow2_clamp: restrict difficulty to 2^n (e.g. 64, 128, 256, etc). This is 
# required for IceRiver and BitMain ASICs, where difficulties further away from
# powers of 2 cause higher error rates.  Using this feature will limit the 
# functionality of vardiff, such that the shares_per_min becomes more of a 
# minimum, rather than a target we can expect to converge on.
pow2_clamp: false

# var_diff: if true, enables the auto-adjusting variable share diff mechanism. 
# Starts with the value defined by the 'min_share_diff' setting, then checks 
# every 10s whether each client is maintaining a 20 shares/minute submission 
# rate, and sends an updated min diff per client if necessary.  Max tolerance 
# is +/- 5% after 4hrs.
var_diff: true

# shares_per_min: number of shares per minute the vardiff engine should target.
# Default value is chosen to allow for 99% confidence in measurement accuracy, 
# which affects fidelity of difficulty update decisions, as well as hashrate
# stability (measured 1hr avg hashrate should be within +/- 10% of actual, with
# the noted confidence.)  Higher values will result in better vardiff engine
# performance and increased hashrate stability.  Lower values will cause 
# vardiff to behave more erratically, while measured hashrate will display 
# larger variations.
#
# Incorrect configuration of this parameter may induce high error rates on 
# IceRiver devices, so it is recommended to avoid unnecessary changes.
# 
# Example values and their resulting confidence levels:
# 20 => 99%, 15 => 95%, 12 => 90%
shares_per_min: 20

# var_diff_stats: if true, print vardiff engine stats to the log every 10s

# manually requesting a new block.  Examples are '500ms', '3s', '1m', etc.
block_wait_time: 3s

# extranonce_size: size in bytes of extranonce, from 0 (no extranonce) to 3. 
# With no extranonce (0), all clients will search through the same nonce-space,
# therefore performing duplicate work unless the miner(s) implement client
# side nonce randomizing.  More bytes allow for more clients with unique 
# nonce-spaces (i.e. no overlapping work), but reduces the per client 
# overall nonce-space (though with 1s block times, this shouldn't really
# be a concern). 
# 1 byte = 256 clients, 2 bytes = 65536, 3 bytes = 16777216.
